## üîç Description

The code implements a real-time ultrasound imaging system for analyzing the internal dynamics of lithium-ion batteries using a custom-designed Row-Column Addressed (RCA) matrix transducer.

It includes:
- **3D image reconstruction algorithms**
- **Physics-informed B-scan and A-scan processing**
- **SNR analysis** for detecting gas bubble formation and charge-state correlation
